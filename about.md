I&rsquo;ve always loved words. I&rsquo;m the girl who will furiously screech at you if you misplace an apostrophe or abuse an adverb, who&rsquo;ll wring her hands over the inevitable downward spiral in linguistic ability encouraged by barrages of poorly-composed emails and text-speak. 

English is my jam, but French and Spanish are my bread and butter. This is an exploratory experiment in hand-drawn lettering, in the etymylogical mysteries of language, in the cultural shifts that change meaning and context. 

I&rsquo;m not quite sure what it is yet. Mostly, it's a daily exercise. I&rsquo;ll see what it turns into.

For now, this is just my love letter to words, made out of words.

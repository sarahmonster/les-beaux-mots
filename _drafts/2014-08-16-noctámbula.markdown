I stayed up until well past the sun came up, learning how to use Jekyll (I like it so far, but I probably won't ever be able to use it for client projects). It's my first holiday in over four years, and this is what I'm choosing to do. I'm not sure if that indicates a problem with me or not. 

Four am is my favourite time of day.
